<h4>Daniel's Junior Software Developer Test</h2>
<p class="greetings"><strong>Hey there!</strong></p>
<p class="description">
Welcome to my Junior's position test. Here, I could perform different exercises that Carlos proposed me using AngularJS. As the job is related to FIFA, 
a major sport organization, I tried to set some exercises topic into football, and for the third exercise I decided to use one of my favorites APIs:  PokeAPI!
<br><br>
As you may have noticed, there are only four exercises here. 
That is because the fifth one is already implemented as there are different views that work interacting with the buttons above ;)<br><br>
Thanks for having me in consideration and I hope you like it!</p>
