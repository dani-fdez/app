<h4>Daniel's Junior Software Developer Evaluation</h2>
<p class="greetings"><strong>Hey there!</strong></p>
<p class="description">
Welcome to my Junior's position evaluation. Here, I could perform different exercises that Digiswit proposed to me using AngularJS. As the job is related to FIFA, 
a major sport organization, I tried to set some exercises topic into football, and for the third exercise I decided to use one of my favorites APIs:  PokeAPI!
<br><br>
As you may have noticed, there are only four exercises here. 
That is because the fifth one is already implemented as there are different views that work interacting with the buttons above ;)<br><br>
Regarding Selenium Test, I have to say that I am not very familiar with the tool, 
but I am currently researching on it and will try to add it in the next days to automate the form of exercise 4.
<br><br>
Thanks for taking me into consideration and I hope you like it!</p>
