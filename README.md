Hello! In this project we will carry out 5 exercises proposed by Digiswit for the Junior Software Developer selection process to which I have applied.

The application is based on **AngularJS** and to run it you only need to follow these steps:

## Instructions

Go to Visual Studio Code > Extensions, search for "Live Server" and install it

Once you have installed it, go to the project's index.html, press F1 on your keyboard and write "Live Server"

Click on "Open with Live Server", it will redirect you to your usual browser and open the app for you.

In case you need more help, feel free to contact me!
